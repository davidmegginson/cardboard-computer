      <h2>DiY cut-out templates</h2>

      <p>(If you have trouble printing from your browser, you can download these templates as PDF in <a href="cardboard-computer-templates-a4.pdf">A4</a> or <a href="cardboard-computer-templates-usletter.pdf">US letter</a> paper size.)</p>

      <p>Print out these templates in landscape orientation and use them to build your own Cardboard Computer. After cutting them out, if you weren't able to print onto card stock, you may want to glue them onto cardboard to stiffen them (they'll be a bit floppy on just paper).</p>

      <p>The outer wheel is always the same. For the inner wheel, you have a choice of a basic one with just the C scale (for multiplication, division, and ratios/conversions), the an advanced one (adding the CI, A, and K scales for three-step multiplication, square roots, and cube roots).</p>

      <p>The wheels need to rotate, and proper alignment is very important for accuracy. The simplest thing is to stick a thumbtack through the centre into something soft (like a cork board). More-portable approaches would involve something like a split-pin, a grommit (which you can get at an arts-and-crafts store or from your local shoe repair place), or even a cleverly-folded twist tie.</p>
      
      <p><b>Optional:</b> You may choose to add a cursor to help with alignment. It should be straight and rotate from the centre, like the wheels. You can use a stiff piece of wire or a piece of see-through plastic with a straight line drawn down the middle.</p>
