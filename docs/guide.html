      <h2>How to use the Cardboard Computer</h2>
      <p>There are two versions of the Cardboard Computer available: the <a href=".">basic version</a> has just the D and C scales, which allow multiplication and division, and is suitable for beginners and for pre-secondary-school students; the <a href="advanced.html">advanced version</a> adds the CI, A, and K scales for three-step multiplication, square roots, and cube roots, and is suitable for secondard-school and post-secondary students.</p>

          <h4>2.1. Orders of magnitude <a class="link" href="#magnitude">ðŸ”—</a></h4>
          <p>Each "trip around the wheel" for the D and C (and CI) scales represents an order of magnitude. That means that 2.1 can also represent 21, 210, 2,100, or (in the other direction) .21 or .021. You need to consider the numbers you're multiplying or dividing to decide which order of magnitude applies, as you'll see in the examples below.</p>

          <h4>2.2. Precision <a class="link" href="#precision">ðŸ”—</a></h4>
          <p>Many answers on the Cardboard Computer will be approximate. The design goal is three <i>significant digits</i>, so you can distinguish between 490 and 491 or 49.0 and 49.1, but not necessarily between 4,900 and 4,901.</p>
          <p>Precision-engineered commercial slide rules were often accurate up to 4 or 5 significant digits for experienced users. You might sometimes be able to achieve that level of precision with your own Cardboard Computer, depending on how large you make it and how carefully you align the two wheels, but regardless, you won't get the long sequence of apparently exact digits that you will with a computerised calculator. That's not necessarily a problem: many classic aircraft and even early rockets were designed mostly using analogue slide rules.</p>

        <h3>3. Multiplication and division <a class="link" href="#basic">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
        <p>The D and C scales are spaced so that at any point, the number on the D scale and the number immediately below on the C scale are in the same proportion: for example, if 4 appears above 2, then 6 will appear above 3 and 8 will appear above 4. This relationship allows for basic multiplication and division by putting one of the numbers above 1 (the <i>unit pointer</i>, with a black background).</p>

          <ol>
            <li>If necessary, multiply or divide each number repeatedly by 10 until it falls in the range 1â€“10.</li>
            <li>Find the first number on the D scale and rotate so that it appears above the black unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Preserving the position of the wheels, find the second number on the C scale</li>
            <li>Read the number directly above on the D scale (you can use the cursor, if you added one, to help line up the two numbers.</li>
            <li>To get the result, multiply by 10 for each time you divided by 10 in step one, and divide by 10 for each time you multiplied by 10.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Divide 41 by 10 once to get 4.1, and divide 12 by 10 once to get 1.2, so that both fall in the range 1â€“10.</li>
            <li>Rotate the wheels until 4.1 on the outer D scale is directly above the unit pointer (1) on the inner C scale.</li>
            <li>Without turning the wheels, find 1.2 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Read the number 4.92 on the D scale directly above 1.2 on the C scale. Use the cursor to help, if you added one.</li>
            <li>Multiple 4.92 by 10 twice (because you divided by 10 twice originally), to get the answer <b>492</b>.</li>

            <li>Find 1.5 on the outer D scale.</li>
            <li>Rotate the wheels until 4 on the inner C scale is directly beneath 1.5.</li>

        <p>While the C and D scales each represents one <a href="#magnitude">order of magnitude</a> (Ã—10), a "trip around" the A scale represents two orders of magnitude (Ã—100), and the K scale, three orders of magnitude (Ã—1,000). This relationship allows you to use the A and K scales together with C to find square roots and cube roots, as well as cubes and squares. There is also a special "c" marking on the D scale that helps for calculating the area of a circle or the volume of a sphere.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Find the original number on the A scale (1â€“100). If the number is greater than 100, keep dividing by 100 until it falls onto the scale (if it is less than one, then <i>multiply</i> by 100).</li>
            <li>Above that number on the C scale, read the square root (multiply by 10 for each time you divided the original number by 100, or divide if you originally multiplied).</li>
            <li>(Note: if you did not add a cursor to your Cardboard computer, use a ruler from the centre to line up the numbers.)</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Find the number you want to square on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Read the square of the number on the K scale (multiply by 100 for each time you divided the original number by 10).</li>
          </ol>
          <p><i>Example 1: âˆš150 = ?:</i></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Divide 150 once by 100 so that it falls onto the K scale (1â€“100).</li>
            <li>Find 1.5 (150Ã·100) on the K scale.</li>
            <li>Read 1.22 directly above on the C scale. Use the cursor (if you added one) or a ruler to help with the alignment.</li>
            <li>Since you divided the original number once by 100, multiply the result once by 10 (âˆš100) to get the <a href="#precision">approximate answer</a> <b>12.3</b>.</li>

            <li>Find 7.8 on the C scale (no multiplication or division required in this case, since it falls in the range 1â€“10).</li>
