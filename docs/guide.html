      <h2>How to use the Cardboard Computer</h2>

      <p>There are two versions of the Cardboard Computer available: the <a href="basic.html">basic version</a> has just the D and C scales, which allow multiplication and division. This version is suitable for beginners and for pre-secondary-school students; the <a href="advanced.html">advanced version</a> adds the CI, A, and K scales for three-step multiplication, square roots, and cube roots. This version is suitable for secondary or post-secondary math users.</p>

      <section id="quick-start">
        <h3>Quick start <a class="link" href="#quick-start">ðŸ”—</a></h3>

        <p>The Cardboard Computer is set up so that the numbers all around the outer scales (D and C) will be in the same proportion to each other no matter how you turn the wheels. For example, if 2 on the D scale is above 1 on the C scale, then 4 will be above 2 and so on:</p>

        <table class="scale-example">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>D scale</th>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>7</td>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>C scale</th>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>1.5</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>2.5</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>3.5</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>4.5</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>To divide, rotate the wheels to place the divisor above the dividend (just as if you were writing a fraction), then read the quotient on the D scale above 1 (the "unit pointer") on the C scale. With the wheels set up as in the above table, 4Â Ã·Â 2, 6Â Ã·Â 3, and 8Â Ã·Â 4 all equal 2.</p>

        <p>To multiply, place the first factor on the D scale above one, then read the product on the D scale above the second factor on the C scale. So, using the same diagram (where you've rotated the wheels to place 2 above 1), 2Â Ã—Â 2Â =Â 4, 2Â Ã—Â 3Â =Â 6, and 2Â Ã—Â 4Â =Â 8.</p>

        <p>For bigger or smaller numbers, <a href="#magnitude">move the decimals around</a> as needed, and things still work (e.g. 80Â Ã·Â 40 is still 2, while 80Â Ã·Â 4 is 20). You can picture either scale like this (extending indefinitely in both directions).</p>

        <p>The D and C scales are spaced so that at any point, the number on the D scale and the number immediately below on the C scale are in the same proportion: for example, if 4 appears above 2, then 6 will appear above 3 and 8 will appear above 4. This relationship allows for basic multiplication and division by putting one of the numbers above 1 (the <i>unit pointer</i>, with a black background).</p>

        <h3>3. Ratios and conversions <a class="link" href="#ratios">ðŸ”—</a></h3>

        <p>Since ratios are consistent all around the C and D scales, you can use them to convert numbers (e.g. distance, currency), adjust things by ratios (e.g. tripling a recipe), and so on.  The nice thing is that you need to set the wheel only once, and then you can keep reading different numbers from it.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Set the first number of the ratio on the outside (D) scale.</li>
          <li>Set the second number of the ratio on the inside (C) scale.</li>
          <li>Read a number anywhere on either scale, and find its equivalent directly above or below on the other scale.</li>
        </ol>

        <section id="simple-conversions">
          <h4>3.1. Simple conversions  <a class="link" href="#simple-conversions">ðŸ”—</a></h4>

          <p>The simplest conversions are ratios one of the sides is 1 (e.g. 1 mile == 1.6 kilometers, or â‚¬1.00 == Â£1.17). In that case, place the other value over the unit pointer (1) once, and the Cardboard computer becomes a static calculator where you can read results all around the scale without moving the wheel.</p>

          <p><i>Example 1: convert 8 miles to kilometres</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 1.6 on the D scale above the unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 8 (miles) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Read the approximate value <b>12.8Â km</b> (1.28) above on the D scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><i>Example 2: convert 25 Euros (â‚¬) to Pounds Sterling (Â£)</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>(Assume that the conversion rate is Â£1.00 to â‚¬1.17.)</li>
            <li>Place 1.17 on the D scale directly above the unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 25 (2.5) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the <a href="#precision">approximate result</a> <b>â‚¬21.40</b> (2.14) directly below on the C scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><i>Example 3: triple a recipe</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 3 on the D scale above the unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>For each ingredient, find the original value on the C scale and read the new value on the D scale.</li>
            <li>E.g., if the original recipe had 4.5 cups of water, the tripled recipe will have <b>13.5</b> (1.35) cups of water.</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="other-ratios">
          <h4>3.2. Other ratios  <a class="link" href="#other-ratios">ðŸ”—</a></h4>

          <p>Sometimes ratios do not involve 1. Those work exactly the same way, except that you don't use the unit pointer. For example, old cathode-ray TV screens usually had a picture ratio of 4:3, while newer high-resolution flat-screen TVs have a picture ratio of 16:9. Odds in betting are also typically given with two arbitrary integers.</p>

          <p><i>Example 1: calculate the height of a screen with 16:9 aspect ratio, if the screen is 60cm wide.</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 16 on the D scale above 9 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 60 (6.0) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the <a href="#precision">approximate height</a>, <b>33.8Â cm</b>, directly below on the C scale.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><i>Example 2: calculate how much a friendly $15 wager will pay at 8:3 odds</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 8 on the D scale above 3 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find $15 (1.5) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the <a href="#precision">approximate</a> extra return (on top of your original bet), <b>$5.63</b>, directly below on the C scale.</li>
            <li>(Repeat for any other values you need to check, without moving the wheels.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Many artists and architects consider the <a href="">Golden Ratio</a> (approximately 5:3) to be visually appealing. It is easy to estimate using the Cardboard computer.</p>

          <p><i>Example 3: if the main section of a web page is 800Â px wide, how wide should the sidebar be to maintain the Golden Ratio?</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 5 on the D scale above 3 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 800 (8.0) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the result, <b>480Â px</b>, directly below on the C scale.</li>

          <p>1.8Â° Fahrenheit is equal to 1Â° Celsius, so the conversion ratio on the Cardboard Computer is 1.8:1. However, because the scales use different values for freezing, there is one extra step: you have to subtract 32 <i>before</i> converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius, or add 32 <i>after</i> converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit.</p>

          <ul>

          <p>Stop, you might not need to read this!. Most of the time, orders of magnitude won't be a problem: for example, if you divide 75 by 5, it will be obvious that the answer should be 15 rather than 150 or 1.5.  Sometimes, however â€” especially with very large or very small numbers â€” there's a chance of confusion with the zeros or decimal places. In that case, you can apply the rules in this section to ensure you have the correct result.</p>

          <p>Each "trip around the wheel" for the D and C (and CI) scales represents one order of magnitude (10). That means that 2.1 can also represent 21, 210, 2,100, or (in the other direction) .21 or .021. You need to consider the numbers you're multiplying or dividing to decide which order of magnitude applies. For the A scale, each cycle represents two orders of magnitude (100), and for the K scale, each cycle represents three (1,000).</p>

          <p>High-quality commercial slide rules were often accurate up to 4 or 5 significant digits for experienced users. You might sometimes be able to achieve that level of precision with your own Cardboard Computer, depending on how large you make it and how carefully you align the two wheels, but regardless, you won't get the long sequence of apparently exact digits that you will with a computerised calculator.
