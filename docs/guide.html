      <h2>How to use the Cardboard Computer</h2>

      <p>There are two versions of the Cardboard Computer available: the <a href=".">basic version</a> has just the D and C scales, which allow multiplication and division, and is suitable for beginners and for pre-secondary-school students; the <a href="advanced.html">advanced version</a> adds the CI, A, and K scales for three-step multiplication, square roots, and cube roots, and is suitable for secondard-school and post-secondary students.</p>

        <h3>2. Multiplication and division <a class="link" href="#basic">ðŸ”—</a></h3>

        <p>The D and C scales are spaced so that at any point, the number on the D scale and the number immediately below on the C scale are in the same proportion: for example, if 4 appears above 2, then 6 will appear above 3 and 8 will appear above 4. This relationship allows for basic multiplication and division by putting one of the numbers above 1 (the <i>unit pointer</i>, with a black background).</p>

        <h2>3. Ratios and conversions <a class="link" href="#ratios">ðŸ”—</a></h2>

        <p>Since ratios are consistent all around the C and D scales, you can use them to convert numbers (e.g. distance, currency), adjust things by ratios (e.g. tripling a recipe), and so on.  The nice thing is that you need to set the wheel only once, and then you can keep reading different numbers from it.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Set the first number of the ratio on the outside (D) scale.</li>
          <li>Set the second number of the ratio on the inside (C) scale.</li>
          <li>Read a number anywhere on either scale, and find its equivalent directly above or below on the other scale.</li>

        <section id="simple-conversions">
          <h3>3.1. Simple conversions  <a class="link" href="#simple-conversions">ðŸ”—</a></h3>

          <p>The simplest conversions are ratios one of the sides is 1 (e.g. 1 mile == 1.6 kilometers, or â‚¬1.00 == Â£1.17). In that case, place the other value over the unit pointer (1) once, and the Cardboard computer becomes a static calculator where you can read results all around the scale without moving the wheel.</p>

          <p><i>Example 1: convert 8 miles to kilometres</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 1.6 on the D scale above the unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 8 (miles) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Read the approximate value <b>12.8Â km</b> (1.28) above on the D scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><i>Example 2: convert â‚¬20 to Pounds Sterling</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>(Assume that the conversion rate is Â£1.17 to â‚¬1.00.)</li>
            <li>Place 1.17 on the D scale directly above the unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 20 (2.0) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the approximate conversion <b>â‚¬17.10</b> directly below on the C scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><i>Example 3: triple a recipe</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 3 on the D scale above the unit pointer (1) on the C scale.</li>
            <li>For each ingredient, find the original value on the C scale and read the new value on the D scale.</li>
            <li>E.g., if the original recipe had 4.5 cups of water, the tripled recipe will have <b>13.5</b> (1.35) cups of water.</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="other-ratios">
          <h3>3.2. Other ratios  <a class="link" href="#other-ratios">ðŸ”—</a></h3>

          <p>Sometimes ratios do not involve 1. Those work exactly the same way, except that you don't use the unit pointer. For example, old cathode-ray TV screens usually had a picture ratio of 4:3, while newer high-resolution flat-screen TVs have a picture ratio of 16:9. Odds in betting are also typically given with two arbitrary integers.</p>

          <p><i>Example 1: calculate the height of a screen with 16:9 aspect ratio, if the screen is 60cm wide.</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 16 on the D scale above 9 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 60 (6.0) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the <a href="#precision">approximate height</a>, <b>33.8Â cm</b>, directly below on the C scale.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><i>Example 2: calculate how much a friendly $15 wager will pay at 8:3 odds</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 8 on the D scale above 3 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find $15 (1.5) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the <a href="#precision">approximate</a> extra return (on top of your original bet), <b>$5.63</b>, directly below on the C scale.</li>
            <li>(Repeat for any other values you need to check, without moving the wheels.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Many artists and architects consider the <a href="">Golden Ratio</a> (approximately 5:3) to be visually appealing. It is easy to estimate using the Cardboard computer.</p>

          <p><i>Example 3: if the main section of a web page is 800Â px wide, how wide should the sidebar be to maintain the Golden Ratio?</i></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Place 5 on the D scale above 3 on the C scale.</li>
            <li>Find 800 (8.0) on the D scale.</li>
            <li>Read the result, <b>480Â px</b>, directly below on the C scale.</li>

          <p>1.8Â° Fahrenheit is equal to 1Â° Celsius, so the conversion ratio on the Cardboard Computer is 1.8:1. However, because the scales use different values for freezing, there is one extra step: you have to subtract 32 <i>before</i> converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius, or add 32 <i>after</i> converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit.</p>

        <p>While the C and D scales each represents one <a href="#magnitude">order of magnitude</a> (Ã—10), a "trip around" the A scale represents two orders of magnitude (Ã—100), and the K scale, three orders of magnitude (Ã—1,000).

          <p>Stop, you might not need to read this!. Most of the time, orders of magnitude won't be a problem: for example, if you divide 75 by 5, it will be obvious that the answer should be 15 rather than 150 or 1.5.  Sometimes, however â€” especially with very large or very small numbers â€” there's a chance of confusion with the zeros or decimal places. In that case, you can apply the rules in this section to ensure you have the correct result.</p>

          <p>Each "trip around the wheel" for the D and C (and CI) scales represents one order of magnitude (10). That means that 2.1 can also represent 21, 210, 2,100, or (in the other direction) .21 or .021. You need to consider the numbers you're multiplying or dividing to decide which order of magnitude applies. For the A scale, each cycle represents two orders of magnitude (100), and for the K scale, each cycle represents three (1,000).</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Multiply or divide each of the numbers by 10 until they fit into the range 0â€“10, then reverse the operations on the result.</p>
              <p><i>Example: 15Â Ã—Â 400Â =Â ?</i></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Divide 15 by 10 once to get 1.5 (in the range 0â€“10) and 400 by 10 twice to get 4.</li>
                <li>Following the instructions in the <a href="#multiplication">multiplication section</a>, you'll end up with the result 6.</li>
                <li>Multiply 6 by 10 three times (reversing the three division operations).</li>

              <p>Multiply or divide each of the numbers by 10 until they fit into the range 0â€“10. On the result, reverse the operations from the first number (dividend), then <i>repeat</i> them (without reversing) for the second (divisor).</p>
              <p>If the second number (divisor) is smaller than the first (dividend), divide once more by 10.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Divide 600 by 10 twice to get 6 (in the range 0â€“10), and multiply .3 by 10 once to get 3.</li>

                <li>Multiply by 10 twice (reversing the division operations on 600), then multiply by 10 once more (<i>repeating</i> the multiplication operation on .03)</li>
                <li>The answer is <b>2,000</b> (2Â Ã—Â 10Â Ã—Â 10Â Ã—Â 10).</li>

                <li>Multiply by 10 once (reversion the division operation on 30), then divide by 10 twice (<i>repeating</i> the division operations on 700)</li>
                <li>Because the dividend 30 is less than divisor 700, divide by 10 once more.</li>
                <li>The <a href="#precision">approximate answer</a> is <b>.429</b> (4.29Â Ã—Â 10Â Ã·Â 10Â Ã·Â 10Â Ã·Â 10).</li>

              <p>(Note: for squares, apply in the opposite order: multiply or divide the original value by 10 until it fits on the C scale, then divide or multiply the result on the A scale by 100 the same number of times.)</p>

          <h3>6.2. Precision <a class="link" href="#precision">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
          <p>Many answers on the Cardboard Computer will be approximate. The design goal is three <i>significant digits</i>, so you can distinguish between 490 and 491 or 49.0 and 49.1, but not necessarily between 4,900 and 4,901.</p>
          <p>High-quality commercial slide rules were often accurate up to 4 or 5 significant digits for experienced users. You might sometimes be able to achieve that level of precision with your own Cardboard Computer, depending on how large you make it and how carefully you align the two wheels, but regardless, you won't get the long sequence of apparently exact digits that you will with a computerised calculator. That's not necessarily a problem: many classic aircraft and even early rockets were designed mostly using analogue slide rules.</p>
