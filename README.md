## Embedding in your own web pages

(Note: you will also need to copy some style rules from docs/style.css â€” I'll fix that later.)

The main code is in docs/modules/cardboard-computer.js

To build a new circular sliderule (CardboardComputer), create an element like this in your HTML:

```
<figure id="sliderule"></figure>
```

Then include the CardBoardComputer like this

```
<script type="text/javascript" defer="defer">
import("./modules/cardboard-computer.js").then((cc) => {
    new cc.CardboardComputer("sliderule", { advanced: false });
});
</script>
```

To use the advanced version, change the ``advanced`` option from ``false`` to ``true``.

To add an interactive demo, create a second element in your HTML, like this:

```
<figure id="demo"></figure>
```

and change your import to

```
<script type="text/javascript" defer="defer">
import("./modules/cardboard-computer.js").then((cc) => {
    new cc.CardboardComputer("sliderule", { advanced: false }).activateDemo("demo");
});
</script>
```
